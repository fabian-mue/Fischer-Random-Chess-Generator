# Fischer-Random-Chess-Generator

## Goal

The aim of this project is to build a generator which creates the starting positions of the pieces for the fischer random chess game variation. The starting positions are randomly generated. In total there are 960 unique possible starting positions.

## Approach

The implementation shall be done in C++.

In the first step a generator shall be implemented which outputs a 2D-Array representing the randomly generated starting positions of the chess board.

In the next iteration an attractive graphical representation of the computed positions shall be established.
